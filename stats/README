Statistics Calculator

The file stats.py contains a simple statistical calculator that takes an
arbitrary number of values (either integer or floating point) and calculates
their mean, minimum, maximum, and population standard deviation. This data is
printed to the terminal in interactive use, and can be obtained as a tuple from
the get_stats(sequence) function defined in the module.

Unit tests are included, and can be run by invoking stats_test.py.
